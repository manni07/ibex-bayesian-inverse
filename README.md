# The IBEX Bayesian Inverse Problem

Code solving the Bayesian inverse problem for satellite data collected by the
Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and output from a computer model
attempting to represent the rate at which energetic neutral atoms (ENA) are
generated throughout the heliosphere. The goal is to estimate the posterior
distributions of the input parameter to the computer simulation, given observed
data from the IBEX satellite.

Descriptions of directories and files contained in the top-level directory are
below.

### Directories

- **data**: contains IBEX satellite data, computer model simulation output, and
  synthetic satellite data for testing purposes provided in this dataset
- **papers**: includes any content necessary to compile the manuscript along
  with `R` scripts for toy examples and figure generation
- **presentations**: code used to produce figures and documents for conference
  presentations
- **tests**: various bash, `Python`, and `R` scripts conducting tests to
  evaluate the performance and functionality of our proposed Poisson Bayesian
  inverse problem framework

## Files

- `pois_bayes_inv.R`: contains the function that implements the proposed
  Poisson Bayesian inverse problem framework. Requires computer model
  input/output and field observations
- `mcmc.R`: support functions for our Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
  including proposals and likelihood evaluations
- `helper.R`: contains functions that aid in the processing of IBEX satellite
  and simulator data, particulary in preparation for running our Bayesian
  inverse problem method
- `check.R`: input validation functions
- `vecchia_scaled.R`: original implementation of the Scaled Vecchia GP approximation for use as a surrogate model of the IBEX simulator. Original code found here: https://github.com/katzfuss-group/scaledVecchia

## Dependencies

- Code relies on the following R packages: `R.utils`, `Tmvtnorm`, `GPvecchia`, `GpGp`, `laGP`, `deepgp`, `ggplot2`, `lhs`, `plgp`, `MASS`, `coda`, `ks`, `mvtnorm`, `gridExtra`, `dplyr`, `doParallel`, `parallel`, `scoringRules`
- All packages are available to install via CRAN
- To install all packages in one shot, run `Rscript dependencies.R`
